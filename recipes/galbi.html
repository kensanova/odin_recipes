  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Korean-style short ribs can be found at most Asian markets. The cut, also known as "flanken," refers to a strip of
    beef cut across the bone from the chuck end of the short ribs. Unlike American and European-style short ribs, which
    include a thick slice of bone-in beef, Korean-style short ribs are cut lengthwise across the rib bones.</p>
